# Awfulizer
This is a utility to awfulize text to passive-aggressively respond to those individuals who always seem to want to use ALL CAPS TO WRITE EMAILS AND TEXT!

The text provided is mangled so that letter case is randomized.

Twitter-like hashtags are not mangled (Example: #Awfulizer)

Clicking the 'Awfulize It!' button repeatedly will regenerate new randomized output using the desired options.

##Examples
Using the following text with a hashtag as input:
```
"To be or not to be, that is the question. #Shakespeare Where's Waldo anyway?"
```

Using the defaults:
```
to bE oR nOt TO bE, ThAT Is THE QUeStiON. #Shakespeare wHEre'S wALdO aNyWaY?
```
Using Numbers for Letters:
```
t0 8e or n0T t0 bE, thAt i5 tHe qUE5TioN. #Shakespeare whERE's Wald0 ANyWay?
```

Using Drop some vowels:
```
To b r nt To B, tHt Is ThE quSTn. #Shakespeare WhEre's WaldO ANYWAy?
```

Using all options:
```
t0 b 0r n0T to 8E, Tht 15 tHE qe5T10n. #Shakespeare wHERE'5 waLD0 AnYWAY?
```

## Options
Option swtiches provide the following additional functionality:
- Randomly convert some upper-case letters to a number that looks similar. (i.e. S to 5)
- Randomly drop vowels
